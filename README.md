This project is a Machine Learning-based Fake News Detection System that classifies news articles as real or fake using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system leverages TF-IDF vectorization for text feature extraction and applies a Logistic Regression model to detect misinformation effectively.

Features
- Preprocessing of raw news text data (cleaning, tokenization, vectorization).
- TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) for feature engineering.
- Logistic Regression classifier for fake vs. real classification.
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python 

Libraries/Tools:
- pandas – data loading & preprocessing
- scikit-learn – TF-IDF, Logistic Regression, evaluation metrics
- numpy – numerical operations
